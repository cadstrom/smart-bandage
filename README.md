An intelligent bandage that monitors wound conditions to aid in rapid recovery of serious or chronic wounds.

## PCBs
The bandage module is composed of two PCBs stacked on top of each other, with the device battery situated in-between. The top board hosts the main MCU (the TI CC2640), while the bottom board hosts the power management stage.
